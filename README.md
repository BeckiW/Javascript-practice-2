### :sos: How to get help
Learning how to think as a web developer is learning how to be an expert in problem solving. So whenever you get stuck start with step 1 and continue until problem solved.

1. Google! In English, type in the error message if there is one, search within the language you're using (ie CSS, JavaScript etc).
2. Ask your code buddies in your Company.
3. Ask your fellow students in Slack.
4. Ask Damien or David. Please note: we are part of a sharing community - share the answer with your fellows.

### :boom: Success!

After completing this assignment, you should be getting fairly used to the core principles of the JavaScript language such as variables, types, conditional statement and functions, and you should be getting a little more comfortable with more advanced topics such as arrays and objects, and the functions which can be used to modify or iterate on them. The next assignment will help you build on this even more.
